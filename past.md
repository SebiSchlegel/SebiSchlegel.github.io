I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn.

I was a PhD student under the supervision of [Ben Davison](https://sites.google.com/site/bendavisonmath/) at the University of Edinburgh. My thesis is [here](https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/41071).

### past organization

Together with Ben Davison and Lucien Hennecart, I organised the
[EGRET seminar](https://web.archive.org/web/20240705202924/https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~lhenneca/EGRET.html)
from October 2021 to December 2022.

Together with Ben Brown,
I organised
[Hodge Club](https://web.archive.org/web/20210618214934/https://hodge.maths.ed.ac.uk/tiki/Hodge+Club)
for the academic year 2020-2021.
