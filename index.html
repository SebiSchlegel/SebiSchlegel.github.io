I am a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh.
My advisor is

<h3>
Research interests
</h3>
<p>
My general interests lie in moduli spaces and enumerative geometry. More specifically, I have
been interested in categorified Donaldson&ndash;Thomas theory, cohomology and derived categories
of moduli spaces, and cohomological/categorical Hall algebras.
